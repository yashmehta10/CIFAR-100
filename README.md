# CIFAR-100
Classifying images into 100 categories trained on the standard CIFAR-100 dataset. 

This dataset has 100 classes and has 600 images per class. It is split into 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. Further the 100 classes are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
Here is an example of classes in the CIFAR-100:

Superclass | Classes
